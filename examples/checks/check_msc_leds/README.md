# Check ESP32-LyraTD-MSC Board LEDs

The ESP32-LyraTD-MSC has 14 LEDs (twelve blue, one green and one red) that may be individually switch on and off. The purpose of this application is to provide a simple demonstration how to operate LEDs as well as a quick verification that all LEDs are operational. The application is switching each LED on in a sequence one by one. When all LEDs are on, they are switch off in the same order. The sequence advances every second and repeats without a definite end until the board is reset or the power is cycled.

To run this example you need ESP32-LyraTD-MSC board.
